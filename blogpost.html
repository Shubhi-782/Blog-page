            <h1>What is NFT?</h1>
            <p>Let’s dive into more detail. To begin with, non-fungible simply states that one item cannot be exchanged
                for another. In NFTs, a token is merely a certification of validity stored on a blockchain, making the
                currency traceable and available to all. As a result, an NFT is a one-of-a-kind virtual currency that
                can take the shape of paintings, films, music, or any other type of digital production..</p><br>
            <h2>Benefits of using NFT</h2>
            <p>Gamers and collectors can now acquire the irreversible ownership of in-game goods plus other unique
                properties and profit from those due to the arrival of blockchain technology. In certain virtual worlds,
                including the Sandbox as well as Decentraland, people have the opportunity to develop and commercialize
                facilities. Facilities like casinos as well as amusement parks. On a secondary NFT marketplace, they can
                also trade particular digital objects acquired during playtimes, such as outfits, characters, and
                currency in-game. By how they changed the gaming and collectibles market, NFTs are becoming extremely
                popular with cryptocurrency consumers and companies. A maximum of $175 million has been invested in NFTs
                since December 2017.</p><br>
            <h2>Practical Use Cases of NFT </h2>
            <p>Game makers have shown a great deal of interest in NFTs. NFTs can be used to keep track of who owns what
                in-game, drive in-game markets, and give a variety of other benefits to gamers.

                In many regular games, you can purchase goods to be used in your gameplay. If the thing was an NFT,
                though, you might repay your investment by trading it once the game is over. If that piece gets more
                valuable, you might turn a profit.

                As producers of the NFT, game makers might gain a commission each time an element is traded in the
                public marketplace. As a result, a much more mutually advantageous business paradigm emerges, in which
                both participants and developers profit from the supplementary NFT market.</p><br>
